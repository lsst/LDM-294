\subsubsection{1.02C.03.04: Alert Generation Pipeline}

This WBS element covers the construction of the software,
together with its associated configuration files, test suites and
documentation, which is used to produce all information necessary to
build the LSST alert stream.  This will include work in the areas of:

\begin{itemize}

\item Template optimization -- An example area of optimization is that of reducing
false positives due to the presence of differential chromatic refraction in the
data used to build the templates.
\item Image differencing -- Production of algorithms needed to produce optimal
image differences in all contexts LSST expects to operate in (i.e. both low and high galactic
latitude).
\item Difference image measurement -- Dipole, point source (positive and negative), and trailed source
measurement are all needed.

\end{itemize}
