\subsubsection{1.02C.04.02: Calibration Products}

This WBS element covers the construction of the software, together with
its associated configuration files, test suites and documentation, which
is used to produce the LSST calibration products. Calibration products
are used in the LSST Science Pipelines (both Alert Production and Data
Release Production) to:

\begin{itemize}

\item{Characterize detector anomalies;}
\item{Correct for sensor cross-talk;}
\item{Perform photometric calibration through understanding the throughput of
      the LSST system and the transmissivity of the atmosphere.}

\end{itemize}
