maintenance tasks that pertain to the pipelines and algorithms developed
in the other 02C.04 WBS elements and elswhere in the project. It
includes work to construct and maintain an end-to-end Data Release
Production test system and ongoing maintenance to adapt the pipelines to
changes elsewhere in the system. It also includes providing high-level,
scientist and operator facing documentation describing the the system as
delivered. Finally, it includes the construction of QC measurement generators
which will be used to verify that pipelines are functioning correctly during
operations.
