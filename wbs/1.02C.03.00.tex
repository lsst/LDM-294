\subsubsection{1.02C.03.00: Management, Leadership \& Integration}

This WBS element covers project management and scientific leadership of the
Alert Production group. It includes effort to develop the overall plan
for the work of the group, to schedule that work, to perform day-to-day
technical and control account management of the team, to coordinate
development with other parts of the LSST WBS, and to contribute to the
operation of the DM Subsystem Science Team.

This is also the WBS under which integration or other cross-cutting work
is accomplished.
