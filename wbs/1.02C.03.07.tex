\subsubsection*{1.02C.03.07: Transform fitting on stacks of images}

This WBS element covers the construction of the software, together with
its associated configuration files, test suites and documentation, which
will allow for high precision photometric and astrometric calibration of
objects using multiple apperitions of each object.

Major features of this work will be:
\begin{itemize}

\item Photometric zeropoint fitting on scales larger than a chip.
\item Support photometric zeropoints which vary on scales smaller than a chip.
\item Support fitting composeable astrometric models that can represent
distortions on a variety of scales from multiple different sources.
\item The above will allow the distortions from the optical system to be
separated from the distortions imprinted by the atmosphere.

\end{itemize}
