\subsubsection{1.02C.04.03: Image Characterization}

This WBS element covers the construction of the software, together with
its associated configuration files, test suites and documentation, which
is used to characterize and calibrate each exposure as part of the Data
Release Production processing. This will include:

\begin{itemize}

\item{Estimation of the point spread function;}
\item{Modelling the background;}
\item{Developing astrometric and photometric calibration solutions.}

\end{itemize}
