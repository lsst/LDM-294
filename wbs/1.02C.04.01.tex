\subsubsection*{1.02C.04.01: Software Primitives}

This WBS element covers the construction of low-level, re-usable software
primitives which form the core libraries underlying the LSST Science
Pipelines. It includes the production of test suites demonstrating the correct
operation of these primitives and technical, developer-focused documentation
describing their use.
