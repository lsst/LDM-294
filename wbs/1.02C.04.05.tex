\subsubsection{1.02C.04.05: Detection \& Deblending}

This WBS element covers the construction of the software, together with its
associated configuration files, test suites and documentation, which are used
to detect sources on astronomical images, and to decompose detections which
consist of multiple overlapping astronomical objects into their constitutent
parts (``deblending''). It also includes functionality to merge redundant
processing carried out in the overlapptng regions of the LSST sky
tessellation.
