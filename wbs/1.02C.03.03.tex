\subsubsection{1.02C.03.03: Alert Distribution System}

This WBS element covers the construction of the software,
together with its associated configuration files, test suites and
documentation, which will make up the alert distribution system.
DIAObjects and ancillary data necessary for alert packet assembly will be delivered
to this system.  There are three parts to the alert distribution system:
\begin{itemize}

\item Robust, redundant message queue -- DIAObjects and ancillary data will be delivered to the 
message queue by the alert generation pipeline.
\item Flexible stream filtering system -- Will operate on the packaged alert stream.  This will provide
the interface to both community broker and to the minimal LSST provided filtering system.
\item Alert database -- All alerts will be dumped (possibly verbatim) to a database that can be replayed
later from any point in the stream.

\end{itemize}
