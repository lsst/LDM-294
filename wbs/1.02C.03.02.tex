\subsubsection*{1.02C.03.02: Catalog Association for Alert Production}

This WBS element covers the construction of the software,
together with its associated configuration files, test suites and
documentation, which is used to associate
DIASources with other entities required for alert packet construction.
Specifically, this will include association with solar system objects
and previously constructed DIAObjects.

This will also cover the work necessary to carry out the updating
of DIAObjects with the addition of another DIASource.
