\subsubsection{1.02C.03.01: Single Frame Processing}

This WBS element covers the construction of the software,
together with its associated configuration files, test suites and
documentation, used to produce the single frame processing pipeline
This pipeline produces calibrated images from raw images.  The
focus is on a pipeline that produces science frames ready for image
differencing, but is expected to result in many pieces that can be re-used
in the data release production system.
