\section{Data Management Problem/Conflict Resolution }
The above organizational structure allocates significant responsibility to lead institutions.  As such, when problems arise that cannot be solved with the responsibility and scope allocated to an institution, the path of escalation and resolution of such problems must be clear.

Any intra institutional problem should be brought as early as possible to the DM Project manager. The PM will attempt to mediate a resolution. The PM will consult with DMLT, DM System Science Team and DM Systems Engineering if there are Scientific or technical impacts to be considered.

Should an issue need to be escalated the PM will bring it up in the weekly LSST project managers meeting.
In that forum a way forward will be agreed with the LSST project manager and other subsystem managers.
