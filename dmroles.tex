\end{itemize}

\subsection{Product Owner \label{role:prodo}}

A product owner is responsible for the quality and acceptance of a particular product.
The product owner should sign off on the requirements to be fulfilled in every delivery and therefore also on any descopes or enhancements.
The product owner should define tests which can be run to prove a delivery meets the requirements due for that product.

\subsection{Pipelines Scientist \label{role:pipe}}

Several DM products come together to form the LSST pipeline. The Pipelines Scientist is the product owner for the overall pipeline.

The Pipelines Scientist should:

\begin{itemize}

\item Provide guidance and test criteria for the full pipeline including how QA is done on the products
\item Keep the big picture of where the codes are going in view. Predominantly the algorithms, but also the implementation and architecture (as part of the Systems Engineering Team \secref{sect:sysengt}).
\item Advise on how we should attack algorithmic problems, providing continuing advice to subsystem product owners as we try new things.
\item Advise on calibration issues, provide understanding of the detectors from a DM point of view
\item Advise on the overall (scientific) performance of the system, and how we'll test it.  Thinking about all the small things that we have to get right to make the overall system good.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Systems Engineer \label{role:sysengineer}}

With the Systems Engineering Team (\secref{sect:sysengt}) the Systems Engineer owns the DM entries in the risk register and is generally in charge of the \textit{process} of building DM products.

As such, the Systems Engineer is responsible for managing requirements as they pertain to DM.
This includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item Update and ensure traceability of the high level design \& requirements documents: DMSR (\citeds{LSE-61}), OSS (\citeds{LSE-30}), and LSR (\citeds{LSE-29})
\item Oversee work on lower level requirements documents
\item Ensure  that the system is appropriately modeled in terms of e.g. drawings, design documentation, etc
\item Ensure  that solid verification plans and standards are established within DM
\end{itemize}

In addition, the Systems Engineer is responsible for the process to define \& maintain DM interfaces (internal and external)

\begin{itemize}
\item Define and enforce standards for internal interfaces
\item Direct the Interface Scientist's (\secref{role:dmis}) work on external ICDs
\end{itemize}

The Systems Engineer shall chair the DM Change Control Board (\secref{sect:dmccb})

\item{Select and advocate appropriate software engineering techniques}
\item{Choose the technologies which are used within the codebase}
\item{Minimize the exposure of DM to volatile external dependencies}

\end{itemize}

The Software Architect will work closely with the Systems Engineer (\secref{role:sysengineer}) to ensure that processes are in place for tracing requirements to the codebase and providing hooks to ensure that requirement verification is possible.

\subsection{Operations Architect \label{role:opsarc}}

\textit{Margaret or Don perhaps some text here ...}

The DM Operations Architect is responsible for ensuring that all elements of the DM Subsystem, including operations teams, infrastructure, middleware, applications, and interfaces,
come together to form an operable system.

\subsection{Configuration Manager (CM)}\label{role:cm}

%A configuration management role exists both at DM and Data Facility levels this could be the same individual
The DM Configuration Manager (CM) is responsible for Configuration Management activities inside DM and NCSA(?).
The following list is not exhaustive, but is intended as a guideline to the CM activities:

\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure that Configuration Management Plan (CMP) is correctly applied and provide appropriate reasons in case of non conformance's
\item Define  which Configuration Items are to be managed in the Configuration Item List
\item Define the Product Baseline
\item Support changes to Configuration Items within the DMCCB
\item Manage the delivery of software products
\item Maintain the Configuration Item List
\item Manage the configuration control resources used by DM
\item Maintain an awareness of the relationship between  the elements of the Product Baseline (in order for instance to be able to answer the question: ``What is the environment and which software is installed?'')
 \item Check that the Product Assurance and CMP procedures are correctly applied when Configuration Items are changed
 \item Participate in DMCCB activities
\end{itemize}

The Configuration Manager is the secretary of the CCB and works with the support of the Scientific and Technical Leaders and participates in the CCB monitoring the development and change control process.

\subsubsection{Configuration Item List}

The Configuration Item List (CIL) is the list of items that are maintained under configuration control.
CUs and DPC need to report their configuration items in the CIL with an adequate level of details.
CIL is part of the development plan but may be written in a separate document to which the development plan refers.

The Configuration Manager in charge has to identify the configuration items to include in the CIL, with the help of the technical leader and to maintain it when changes to the configuration items happen.


\subsubsection{Release management\label{sect:relMng}}

In DM usually each product will be released once per cycle.
Additional releases may be done in case of bug fixing, urgent issues, or in case that the previous one is incomplete.

Each release needs to be identified with:

\begin{itemize}
\item Configuration Item
\item Documentation:
\subitem User Manual: to be updated each major release
\subitem Requirements Specification: to be updated each major release
\subitem Test Specification: to be updated each major release
\subitem Release Note: new document each major release, updated for patch releases
\subitem Test Report: new document each major release, updated for patch releases
\item Latest Release in the \texttt{master} branch in GitHub.
\end{itemize}
This information identifies a product baseline.

%Release preparation is in charge of the DU leader and is subject to CCB approval.
The release manager is in charge of preparing the release with the technical lead for the product.
After CCB approval, the release will be delivered to NCSA.

\subsubsection{Configuration Baseline \label{sect:BSLdef}}

A Configuration Baseline (CB) represents the approved status of the project at key milestones like formal review or at the beginning of test activities.

Configuration Baselines are applicable to hardware and software, and will include the documents that describe the CIs and their status.

\subsection{Lead Institution Senior Positions}

Each Lead Institution (as defined in \secref{sect:leadtutes}; see also \tabref{tab:wbs}) has a T/CAM and Scientific or Engineering Lead, who jointly have overall responsibility for a broad area of DM work, typically a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Level 2 element. They are supervisors of the team at their institution, with roles broadly analogous to those of the DM Project Manager and Project Scientist.

\subsubsection{Technical/Control Account Manager (T/CAM) \label{role:tcam}}

Technical/Control Account Managers have managerial and financial responsibility
for the engineering teams within DM. Each T/CAM is responsible for a specific set of WBS elements. Their detailed responsibilities include:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{Develop, resource load, and maintain the plan for executing the DM construction project within the scope of their WBS}
  \item{Synchronize the construction schedule with development in WBS elements managed by other T/CAMs}
  \item{Maintain the budget for their WBS and ensuring that all work undertaken is charged to the correct accounts}
  \item{Work with the relevant Science Leads and Product Owners (\secref{role:prodo}) to develop the detailed plan for each cycle and sprint as required}
  \item{Work with the DM Project Controller (\secref{role:pcon}) to ensure that all plans and milestones are captured in the LSST Project Controls system}
  \item{Perform day-to-day management of staff within their WBS}
  \item{Perform the role of ``scrum-master'' during agile development}
  \item{Report activities as required, including providing input for monthly status reports.}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Institutional Science/Engineering Lead \label{role:scilead}}

The Institutional Science/Engineering Leads serve as product owners (\secref{role:prodo}) for the major components of the DM System (Alert Production, Data Release Production, Science User Interface etc).

In addition, they provide scientific and technical expertise to their local engineering teams.

They work with the T/CAM who has managerial responsibility for their product to define the overall construction plan and the detailed cycle plans for DM.

Institutional science leads are members of the DM System Science Team (\secref{sect:dmsst}) and, as such, report to the DM Subsystem Scientist (\secref{role:dmps}).

\subsection{DM Science Validation Scientist}
\label{role:dmsvs}

The DM Science Validation Scientist leads the Science Validation team (\secref{sect:dmsvt}).
They have primary responsibility for planning, executing and analyzing the results of science validation activities, as defined in \citeds{LDM-503}; typically, this includes large-scale data challenges.
The Science Validation Scientist is responsible for End to End Science validation and reports to the DM Subsystem Scientist.
