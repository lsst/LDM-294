\section{Data Management Conceptual Architecture \label{sect:dmarc}}

The DM Subsystem Architecture is detailed in \citeds{LDM-148}.
A few of the higher level diagrams are reproduced here to orientate the reader within DM.

During Operations, components of the DM Subsystem will be installed and run in
multiple locations. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\item The Commissioning Cluster, which may be physically at NCSA in Urbana-Champaign
\item The main center in NCSA enclave in Urbana-Champaign
\item The US Data Access Center (DAC), also at NCSA in Urbana-Champaign
\item The Chilean DAC in the Base Facility in La Serena Chile
\item The Satellite Processing Center at CC-IN2P3 in Lyon, France
\end{itemize}

\figref{fig:dmsdeploy} shows the various DM components which will be used in operations and the physical compute environments in which they will be deployed.
Bulk data storage and transport between components is provided by the Data Backbone. This complex piece of infrastructure is displayed in \figref{fig:databb}.

Science users will access the data products produced by LSST through the
Science Platform, as shown in \figref{fig:sciplat}.

\figref{fig:dcs} shows the common infrastructure and services layer which underlies the compute environments.
This does not list specific technologies for management/monitoring, provisioning/deployment, or workload/workflow --- these are still under development --- but consider industry-standard tools such as Nagios, Puppet/vSphere/OpenStack/Kubernetes, and Pegasus.

\subsection{External Interfaces}
The DM external interfaces are controlled by the  ICDs listed in \tabref{tab:icds}.
\begin{table}

\subsubsection{Auxiliary data in DM}
Certain tasks in DM rely on external catalogs and other information. Currently we believe we need:
\begin{enumerate}
		        \item Gaia catalogue (Release 2) as a photometry baseline.
		\end{enumerate}
