\section{Data Management Conceptual Architecture \label{sect:dmarc}}

The \gls{DM} \gls{Subsystem} Architecture is detailed in \citeds{LDM-148}.
A few of the higher level diagrams are reproduced here to orient the reader within \gls{DM}.

During \gls{Operations}, components of the \gls{DM} \gls{Subsystem} will be installed and run in
multiple locations. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \gls{Commissioning} Cluster in the \gls{Base Facility} in La Serena, Chile
\item The \gls{USDF} at \gls{SLAC} in Menlo Park
\item The \gls{IDF} running on Google
\item The \gls{US} \gls{DAC},  at \gls{SLAC} in Menlo Park
\item The Chilean \gls{DAC} in the \gls{Base Facility}
\item The \gls{FrDF} at \gls{CC-IN2P3} in Lyon, France
\item The \gls{UKDF} at \gls{ROE} in Scotland
\end{itemize}

\figref{fig:dmsdeploy} shows the various \gls{DM} components which will be used in operations and the physical compute environments in which they will be deployed.
Bulk data storage and transport between components is provided by the \gls{Data Backbone}. This complex piece of infrastructure is displayed in \figref{fig:databb}.

Science users will access the data products produced by \VRO~ through the
Science Platform, as shown in \figref{fig:sciplat}.

\figref{fig:dcs} shows the common infrastructure and services layer which underlies the compute environments.
This does not list specific technologies for management/monitoring, provisioning/deployment, or workload/workflow --- these are still being selected --- but under consideration are industry-standard tools such as Nagios, Puppet/vSphere/OpenStack/Kubernetes, and Pegasus.

\subsection{External Interfaces \& Auxiliary Data}
The \gls{DM} external interfaces are controlled by the ICDs listed in \tabref{tab:icds}.

      \end{tabular}

\end{table}

In addition, certain tasks in \gls{DM} rely on external catalogs and other information.
The current design requires:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gaia catalog (\gls{Release} 2) as a photometry baseline.
\end{itemize}
