\newglossaryentry{WISE} {name={WISE}, description={Wide-field Survey Explorer}}
\newglossaryentry{Work Breakdown Structure} {name={Work Breakdown Structure}, description={a tool that defines and organizes the LSST project's total work scope through the enumeration and grouping of the project's discrete work elements}}
\newglossaryentry{World Coordinate System} {name={World Coordinate System}, description={a mapping from image pixel coordinates to physical coordinates; in the case of images the mapping is to sky coordinates, generally in an equatorial (RA, Dec) system. The \gls{WCS} is expressed in FITS file extensions as a collection of header keyword=value pairs (basically, the values of parameters for a selected functional representation of the mapping) that are specified in the FITS Standard.}}
\newglossaryentry{afw} {name={afw}, description={LSST's pipeline library code and primitives including images and tables.}}
\newglossaryentry{airmass} {name={airmass}, description={The pathlength of light from an astrophysical source through the Earth's atmosphere. It is given approximately by sec z, where z is the angular distance from the zenith (the point directly overhead, where airmass = 1.0) to the source.}}
\newglossaryentry{algorithm} {name={algorithm}, description={A computational implementation of a calculation or some method of processing.}}
\newglossaryentry{astronomical object} {name={astronomical object}, description={A star, galaxy, asteroid, or other physical object of astronomical interest. Beware: in non-LSST usage, these are often known as sources.}}
\newglossaryentry{background} {name={background}, description={In an image, the background consists of contributions from the sky (e.g., clouds or scattered moonlight), and from the telescope and camera optics, which must be distinguished from the astrophysical background. The sky and instrumental backgrounds are characterized and removed by the LSST processing software using a low-order spatial function whose coefficients are recorded in the image metadata.}}
\newglossaryentry{calibration} {name={calibration}, description={The process of translating signals produced by a measuring instrument such as a telescope and camera into physical units such as flux, which are used for scientific analysis. Calibration removes most of the contributions to the signal from environmental and instrumental factors, such that only the astronomical component remains.}}
\newglossaryentry{camera} {name={camera}, description={An imaging device mounted at a telescope focal plane, composed of optics, a shutter, a set of filters, and one or more sensors arranged in a focal plane array.}}
\newglossaryentry{configuration} {name={configuration}, description={A task-specific set of configuration parameters, also called a 'config'. The config is read-only; once a task is constructed, the same configuration will be used to process all data. This makes the data processing more predictable: it does not depend on the order in which items of data are processed. This is distinct from arguments or options, which are allowed to vary from one task invocation to the next.}}
\newglossaryentry{declination} {name={declination}, description={Often abbreviated Dec, it is a part of an equitorial coordinate pair that expresses the angular distance (usually expressed in degrees) from the Celestial Equator, measured along great circles that intersect the Equatorial poles. Positions south of the equator are given negative sign.}}
\newglossaryentry{epoch} {name={epoch}, description={Sky coordinate reference frame, e.g., J2000. Alternatively refers to a single observation (usually photometric, can be multi-band) of a variable source.}}
\newglossaryentry{flux} {name={flux}, description={Shorthand for radiative flux, it is a measure of the transport of radiant energy per unit area per unit time. In astronomy this is usually expressed in cgs units: erg/cm2/s.}}
\newglossaryentry{git} {name={git}, description={A distributed revision control system, often used for software source code. See the Git User Manual for details. Not developed by LSST DM.}}
\newglossaryentry{metadata} {name={metadata}, description={General term for data about data, e.g., attributes of astronomical objects (e.g. images, sources, astroObjects, etc.) that are characteristics of the objects themselves, and facilitate the organization, preservation, and query of data sets. (E.g., a FITS header contains metadata).}}
\newglossaryentry{patch} {name={patch}, description={An quadrilateral sub-region of a sky tract, with a size in pixels chosen to fit easily into memory on desktop computers.}}
\newglossaryentry{pipeline} {name={pipeline}, description={A configured sequence of software tasks (Stages) to process data and generate data products. Example: Association Pipeline.}}
\newglossaryentry{point spread function} {name={point spread function}, description={The point-spread function (PSF) is the distribution of intensity on a sensor (or image) originating from an unresolved point-source (i.e., a star). Often the PSF is not the same Airy shape as would be expected from a finite-aperture optical system, owing primarily to atmospheric effects and imperfections in the optical system and the detector.}}
\newglossaryentry{provenance} {name={provenance}, description={Information about how LSST images, Sources, and Objects were created (e.g., versions of pipelines, algorithmic components, or templates) and how to recreate them.}}
\newglossaryentry{shape} {name={shape}, description={In reference to a Source or Object, the shape is a functional characterization of its spatial intensity distribution, and the integral of the shape is the flux. Shape characterizations are a data product in the DIASource, DIAObject, Source, and Object catalogs.}}
\newglossaryentry{stack} {name={stack}, description={A record of all versions of a document uploaded to a particular DocuShare handle}}
\newglossaryentry{tract} {name={tract}, description={A portion of sky, a spherical convex polygon, within the LSST all-sky tessellation (sky map). Each tract is subdivided into sky patches.}}
\newglossaryentry{transient} {name={transient}, description={A transient source is one that has been detected on a difference image, but has not been associated with either an astronomical object or a solar system body.}}
