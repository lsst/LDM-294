\newglossaryentry{provenance} {name={provenance}, description={Information about how LSST images, Sources, and Objects were created (e.g., versions of pipelines, algorithmic components, or templates) and how to recreate them.}}
\newglossaryentry{shape} {name={shape}, description={In reference to a Source or Object, the shape is a functional characterization of its spatial intensity distribution, and the integral of the shape is the flux. Shape characterizations are a data product in the DIASource, DIAObject, Source, and Object catalogs.}}
\newglossaryentry{sky map} {name={sky map}, description={A sky tessellation for LSST. The Stack includes software to define a geometric mapping from the representation of World Coordinates in input images to the LSST sky map. This tessellation is comprised of individual tracts which are, in turn, comprised of patches.}}
\newglossaryentry{stack} {name={stack}, description={A record of all versions of a document uploaded to a particular DocuShare handle}}
\newglossaryentry{tract} {name={tract}, description={A portion of sky, a spherical convex polygon, within the LSST all-sky tessellation (sky map). Each tract is subdivided into sky patches.}}
\newglossaryentry{transient} {name={transient}, description={A transient source is one that has been detected on a difference image, but has not been associated with either an astronomical object or a solar system body.}}
